# Epicycles of Analysis
Data analysis is "Hard" <Even if you pros , you'll know this process is *'thought'*
Data analysis is an iterative process:
  * Involved many aspect as you move ,you get information for every step
    * Involved:
                    : 1. Stating and refining the question
                    : 2. EDA
                    : 3. Model Building
                    : 4. Interpret Result
                    : 5. Communicate Result
      *  **For Each , Engage Following Steps** :
      *  **Author Call This As : *Epicycles of data Analysis* .**
                      : 1. Develop Expectations
                      : 2. Collect data
                      : 3. Revising your Expectations OR Fixing the data so your data and your Expectations match.                      
### Setting Expectations :
  * thinking about what you expect before you do anything
### Collecting information :
   * Making Sure your data you've collect/get matches with your Question :D
###  Comparing Expectations to data
   * There's only 2 answer , wheter your Expectations matches or not ,if not you should review the information you get/build :D                       
# How ?                      
  * *Question*
    * **Set Expectations** :
      * Question is of interest to audience
    * **Collect Information** :
      * Literature search/experts
    * **Revise Expectations** :
      * Sharpen Question
  * *EDA*
    * **Set Expectations** :
      * *Data Are Appropriate for question*
    * **Collect Information** :
      * *Make Plots Of data*
    * **Revise Expectations** :
      * *Collect More data OR Refine Question*
  * *Formal Modeling* :
    * **Set Expectations** :
      * *Primary model answer question* {Nothing changed on the model , refers to mathematical function ,Example : y = mx1 + b}
    * **Collect Information** :
      * *Fit Secondary Models , Sensitivity Analysis* {Something changed on the mathematical Function ,Example:  y = mx1 + mx1^2  +b  }
    * **Revise Expectations** :
      * *Revise formal model to include more predictors*
  * *Interpretation* :
    * **Set Expectations** :
      * *Provides a specific & meaningful answer to the question*
    * **Collect Information**:
      * *interpret analyses with focus on *Effect Sizes* and *Uncertainty*
    * **Revise Expectations** :
      * *Revise EDA and/or models to provide specific & interpretable answer*
  * *Communication* :
   * **Set Expectations** :
      * *process & result of analysis are understood,complete & meaningful to audience*
   * **Collect Information** :
      * *Seek Feedback Dude*
   * **Revise Expectations** :
      * *Revise analyses or approach to PResentation*

  You need to read it . Cuz it's easier for you to understand What's going on :D
