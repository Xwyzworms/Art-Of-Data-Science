# Stating and refining the question
## Not an easy things to do , put more effort on thinking a good questions(Sharp) and answerable :D

### Types of question :
  - [1] (Descriptive --> Summarize A characteristic of the dataset)
  - [2] (Exploratory --> Analyze data to see if there are patterns/relationship between variables)
  - [3] (Inferential --> Restatement a proposed hypothesis as a question that would be answered by analyzing different set of data , simple way : what is true from analysis you perform in sample dataset that is  representative to whole population)
  - [4] (Predictive --> Making A prediction , but the question you should ask is that , *WHY* its outputting this way ? what's key predictor ?)
  - [5] (Causal --> More Specific Than inferential Question , Causal tend to ask about whether changing one factor will change another factor , *On Average* , **IN POPULATION** )
  - [6] (Mechanistic --> In depth Specific Question into the data . )
  * In Summary If you want to ask Causal question , you should ask Descriptive,exploratory and so on.
* Jargon --> {"Hypothesis Generating" : looking for patterns that would support proposing {Mengajukan} a hypothesis }  

### Applying the Epicycle to Stating and refining your question
  * Epic Cycle Reminder
  - [1] (Set Expectations about the question)
  - [2] (Collect data ,Create Information about your question)
  - [3] (Compare Expectations with information you've gathered,then REFINE your question.)
### Characteristic of a Good Question
* Remember for every single Question you should ask "*WHY*" , it will help you a lot , for instance you want to ask whether you productive or not ,such as why i ask this question,  it's interest to me ? it's related to my life for future and ect.
  - [1] (Interest to audience)
  - [2] (Has not already been answered)
  - [3] (Plausible (Make Sense Question) )
    * Plausible addition :
      - If your question not Plausible --> The Answer you get might hard to interpret
  - [4] (Answerable --> means you have your data ,and it's possible to answer , case where it's not answerable might related to data ethical problem/resource)
  - [5] (Specificity -->Specific ,sharp question so its not vague )
### Translating a Question into a Data Problem

Here i've found my self hard to grasp the information .but i think author want to identify what make *interpretations* bad.
what i get from here:
  - [1] (Create a good question then think for a while the result how they would look like when doing data analysis) --> Create Expectations
  - [2] (Careful with inappropriate Data when you start analyzing your data set,Why ? This because one head **N** TAIL : means there are multiple interpretations )
    - [2.1] (Problem using inappropriate data --> the result is not interpretable because the underlying way in which the data were collected lead to a *biased* result)
  - [3] (Think about confounding --> a feature/features related to a variable/feature you're currently analyze but you're not considering that feature )
    * Example i guess :
      -  Variable 1 ( taking vitamin D supplements) and your outcome of interest (taking pain reliever medication <<- both is your variable interest ,but you're not realize "Income" Variable might be related to both variables , so think about another variables .
